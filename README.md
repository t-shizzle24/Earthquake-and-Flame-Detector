# Earthquake-and-Flame-Detector
Arduino Project for an Earthquake and Flame Detection which automatically triggers circuit breaking action on detection
THe code was compiled on arduino IDE. The sensor that we used for earthquake vibrations detection is the ADXL345 triple axis accelerometer manufactured by SparkFun electronics company.
SparkFun has made an open source library and a helpful interfacing code for the operation of ADXL345. We took help of this open source code for the operation of ADXL345.
Code for all the other components were compiled in accordance with this library.
